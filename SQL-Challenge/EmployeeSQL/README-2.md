Background
This repository discusses a research project on the employee database at Pewlett Hackard Corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period is in six CSV files.

In this project, a table was created that holds employees data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and the data exploration was conducted to answer the research questions, and discussed in the following parts:

1. Data Modeling
To model the employee data a basic data modeling technique called Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) was used.
 By using this technique six employee database entities or tables are identified. 
 These entities are employees, departments, salaries, titles, department managers, 
 and department employees. The attribute or the data type of the entities also presented. 
 At last, the ER diagram was drawn to visualize the relationships between entities/objects (primary key or foreign keys in a database).

 The ER diagram looks as follows:
