Submitted By: Hamid Zarringhalam

In this assignment I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 

Data Engineering:
This section is about creating the tables under the schema. The Schemal.Sql is under Data Engineering folder

Data Analysis:
This section is about the queries and analysis on the employee database at Pewlett Hackard Corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. The data of this period is stored in six CSV files under "Resources" folder.

The Analysis is stored under "Data Analysis" folder:

In this project, tables were created with the relative filed in the CSV files, then imported the CSVs into a SQL database under the tables, and the data queries was conducted to answer the questions.

Data Modeling:

To model the employee data, ERD data modeling technique calledwhich is called Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) is used.
 By using this technique the relation of tables and KEYs are identified.
